## Tri-diagonal Matrix 

```{Note}
Check why we need to calculate the zero wave number solution seperately?
Check how the output solution dimensionally match the input?
```


```{margin} Dimension matching
The input of tri-diagonal matrix solver in the LESGO code in z direction is from 1 to Nz+1 while most of the variable are stored in 0 to Nz. Need careful consideration here.
