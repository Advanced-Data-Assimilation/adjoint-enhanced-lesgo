## Thermal Boundary Layer withouut Coupling of the Velocity Field to the Temperature Field

> “In this chapter we will first discuss those particular flows with heat transfer for which the velocity field is decoupled from the temperature field. This is the case if the physical properties $\rho$ and $\mu$ are constant, i.e. can be assumed to be independent of the temperature and pressure. This assumption is certainly justified as long as the temperature and pressure differences within the boundary layer are small.” ([Schlichting and Gersten, 2017, p. 209](zotero://select/library/items/DIAHPUMV))

> “The velocity field will now be assumed to be that of a flow at high Reynolds number, i.e. the flow will have boundary–layer character.” ([Schlichting and Gersten, 2017, p. 210](zotero://select/library/items/DIAHPUMV))

u^*\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x^*} + \overline{v}\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{\text{Pr}} \frac{\partial^2 \theta}{\partial \overline{y}^2} + \text{Ec} \left(\frac{\partial u^*}{\partial \overline{y}}\right)^2

> “There are more different kinds of boundary conditions possible for thermal boundary layers than for velocity boundary layers, since these latter are fixed by the no–slip condition and the impermeability of the wall.” ([Schlichting and Gersten, 2017, p. 211](zotero://select/library/items/DIAHPUMV))
